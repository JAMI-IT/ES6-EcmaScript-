// JavaScript variables can hold different data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
let length=145;
let last_name="Jami";
let x={firstName:"Abdul Rehman", lastName:"Jami"};
console.log(x);

// The Concept of Data Types
// In programming, data types is an important concept.

// Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:
x="Jami" + 21;
console.log(x);
x=16+5 +"  " +"Jami";
